//! A 1:1 reimplementation of Banished's game logic.
//!
//! Every routine here is ported from the shipped binaries (see `docs/`), keeping the original's
//! arithmetic order and float precision so that results match the game bit for bit. Ported
//! functions name their source address; tests compare against data from real save files.
